          <p> Ultimately, my goal for my career is to be a developer. I think I would prefer the back-end
              of web development(for some reason the gears behind all the nice graphic designs and artistic expressions
              found within websites interest me far more). But who knows?!, all of that is subject to change, I may eat my own
              words on this one. One thing remains firm however, I like to solve problems, and development is the perfect sandbox 
              to play in for that goal
