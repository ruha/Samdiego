          <p> Huge fan of "The Walking Dead", or anything Zombie related really. I will have to say though,
               that TWD is my favorite due to the implementation of a meaningful story. "How I met your mother"
               is another great show to binge watch, lots of seasons, lots of content to keep one entertained.
               difinitely a binge watcher, I don't care for commercials, or waiting a week for the next episode.
               I want hours of content at a time.
