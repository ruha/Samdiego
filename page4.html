          <p> My future plans, admittedly, are completely unrealistic. Of these two properties, located in Uruguay,
              the first is a rather ostentatious mansion, which would require a staff for upkeep, the second, is a castle
              in the same country...and sovereign nations tend to frown upon the idea of private individuals purchasing 
              their national landmarks for thier living/recreational and work related purposes. One can only dream though!
              Ultimately, I would like to have a sucessful career and retire somewhere in South America.
